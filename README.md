Minimizing the Negative Log Likelihood Fit to Retrieve Neutrino Oscillation Parameters From Simulated T2K Data

In this investigation, a Negative Log Likelihood (\textit{NLL}) fit for simulated T2K experiment data was considered to extract neutrino oscillation parameters. Minimization of the \textit{NLL} fit was achieved by implementing a pipeline of methods with simulated annealing adopted as the method of choice, locating  \textit{NLL}$_{\textit{min}}$ at \boldmath $\hat{\theta}_{23} = 0.6370 \pm 0.0117$ rad and \boldmath $\hat{\Delta m}_{23}^2 = (290.8 \pm 5.9) \times 10^{-5}$ (eV)$^2$, considering cross-section of interaction to be 1. Taking a linearly increasing cross-section as a function of energy, \textit{NLL}$_{\textit{min}}$ was achieved at \boldmath $\hat{\theta}_{23} = 0.6759 \pm 0.0142$ rad, \boldmath $\hat{\Delta m}_{23}^2 = (315.2 \pm 5.0) \times 10^{-5}$ (eV)$^2$ and \boldmath $\hat{\alpha} = 1.467 \pm 0.061$ m$^2$/GeV. A justification of the computational methods used and the results therefore produced, is discussed.
