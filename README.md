Minimizing the Negative Log Likelihood Fit to Retrieve Neutrino Oscillation Parameters From Simulated T2K Data

A Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) fit for simulated T2K experiment data was considered to extract neutrino oscillation parameters. Minimization of the NLL fit was achieved by implementing a pipeline of methods with simulated annealing adopted as the method of choice, locating
